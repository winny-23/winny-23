## PROJECT OVERVIEW

#### The Evolution of Action Movies: From Explosions to Animation

In the early 1980s, action movies were all the rage. Films like "Die Hard" (1988) and "Terminator" (1984) dominated the box office, with their high-octane action sequences, memorable one-liners, and charismatic leads. These films were made on relatively modest budgets, with "Die Hard" costing around $28 million and "Terminator" costing around $6.4 million.

As the decades passed, the action movie genre continued to evolve. The 1990s saw the rise of martial arts films, with movies like "Rush Hour" (1998) and "Enter the Dragon" (1993) showcasing impressive fight choreography. These films had slightly higher budgets, with "Rush Hour" costing around $33 million and so on.
